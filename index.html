            <p id="buck">Have you ever wished a flawless face of makeup could remain intact, so that when you
                wake up you can just
                roll out of bed ready to go? Thanks to <strong><em>permanent makeup</em></strong>, that wish could
                become a reality. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Permanent makeup</em></strong> refers to cosmetic tattoos that help you recreate your
                favorite makeup looks in a
                semipermanent manner. Chances are, you've already heard of microblading. Thanks to an exponentially
                exploding interest in brows over the past few years, the eyebrow-tattooing technique has gone
                mainstream. But brows are just the beginning. You can also get just-bitten pink lips, sharp-lined eyes,
                or even faux freckles.</p>
            <p>"<strong><em>Permanent makeup</em></strong> has come a long way since your grandma tattooed her brows
                on," says <strong>Anusha Shahu</strong>,
                a freelancer with a experience of almost 10 years in the makeup industry . "Nowadays, the technique and
                artistry has truly
                evolved to provide people with the most natural enhancements that will make your friends wonder what
                you've done to look so fresh and polished."</p>
            <p>Though this is a wonderful option for those who crave a daily makeup look that's fuss-free, as cosmetic
                ink gets more common, it's important to remember that the key term in semipermanent makeup is
                "permanent." As seamless and easy as it sounds, in the end, you are still making a permanent decision —
                at least one that'll last for a few years.</p>
            <p><strong style="background-color: #17df92;">Note :</strong> Even though the process of permanent makeup is
                similar to tattooing but there is
                a
                difference between them. tattooing uses the color which looks artificial but when it comes to permanent
                makeup the color use in this are micro-pigment which are truly natural but stays only a few years.</p>

            <h3><strong>What is microblading?</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Microblading</strong> , is probably the most popular permanent makeup treatment out there. Using
                a
                fine
                needle, the artist deposit pigment directly under the skin to mimic the strokes of natural eyebrow hairs
                to
                recreate fuller, natural-looking brows.</p>
            <p>"The microblade tool has very fine needles. You would use this tool along with implanting the ink to
                create
                each
                hair stroke," brow artist and licensed esthetician Dana Pellegrino explains. "Once a client says they
                don't
                want
                them to look too dark or too big, I know they want this method. Microblading fills in the sparse areas
                of an
                already full brow or gives the gift of a brow for some."</p>
            <p>You may also hear names like brow feathering or microshading. "People will claim different techniques for
                marketing purposes," says <strong><em>Anusha</em></strong>. Other techniques still fall under the
                umbrella
                of
                natural-looking hair strokes.
                The important part is to study examples of your artist's work and make sure you're a fan before booking
                an
                appointment.</p>
            <h3><strong>Who should get microblading?</strong></h3>
            <p>If filling in your brows is a crucial part of your beauty routine, microblading might not be a bad idea.
                To
                its
                credit, the procedure is dermatologist-approved. "I think it is an ideal treatment for restoration of
                the
                eyebrows," says Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist Ava Shamban, MD. She's such a fan of the
                procedure that she even does microblading procedures in her own clinics. There's one major pro to
                getting
                your
                work done at a dermatologist's office: "We can be prepared for the unforeseen complications and act or
                react
                accordingly," says Dr. Shamban.</p>
            <p>But even if you choose to go with a cosmetic tattoo artist without a medical degree, talk to your
                dermatologist
                to make sure your skin is amenable to a tattoo. Bray turns away potential clients with oily skin or
                large
                pores.
                "Microblading only looks great when you can achieve fine details," says Bray. "People with oily skin
                won't
                heal
                with the crisp strokes you need to achieve a natural look."</p><br>
            <h3><strong>How long does microblading last?</strong></h3>
            <p>microblading does (for the most part) fade over time, making permanent eyebrows more like semipermanent
                eyebrows.
                "Microblading is a very natural way in achieving fuller-looking brows without the huge commitment,"
                Pellegrino
                says. "These brows can last from 1 to 3 years depending on one's skin type and lifestyle." If you use
                lots
                of
                exfoliating skin-care ingredients or don't shield your brows from the sun, you may notice them fading
                quicker.
            </p>
            <p>No matter what your lifestyle, though, you should expect to return to your artist 12 to 18 months for a
                touch-up.
                Exactly when to come back is up to you. "The pigments are designed to slowly fade over time, so it's a
                personal
                preference when to come in for maintenance once the color starts to lose concentration," says Bray.
                "Some
                people
                fade a little bit and they want more; others let it almost all fade out before they come back." At a
                maintenance
                appointment, the artist will add color concentration to the existing work</p><br>
            <h3>What are the potential risks of microblading?</h3>
            <P>Infection is a potential risk for any permanent makeup tattoo (as well as just about any type of body
                tattoo).
                "With all of these, we are opening the skin and blood-borne pathogens can be spread, so you want to make
                sure
                technicians are using disposable, single-use tools," says Anusha.</P>
            <p>The best way to avoid this sort of risk is "to opt for a experienced technician and have it done under a
                clean
                technique." Your technician should open the single-use tool in front of you. Infection can also occur if
                clients
                don't follow the proper aftercare, says Bray, which means keeping the area dry and staying out of the
                sun
                for
                about 10 days. Your artist should also schedule a follow-up appointment after six weeks or so to ensure
                the
                skin
                has healed properly and that you're happy with the results.</p>
            <p>Aside from the medical risks, there's also the chance that you'll be unhappy with the finished work and
                stuck
                with brows you don't love for over a year. The only way to truly avoid this is to research your artist
                to
                ensure
                their work resonates with your personal style.</p>
            <h3><strong>How much does microblading cost?</strong></h3>
            <p>Microblading cost start from a amount of <span>&#8377;</span>5000 for the very basic color and style and
                goes
                upto the max amount of <span>&#8377;</span>12000 . You should see a higher price differences when you
                choose
                to
                done this in a permanent makeup studio or any other parlour, but Anusha has a aim to give people a
                perfect
                and
                prettier look to everybody so she kept these prices as low as possible , also there are no home service
                charges
                . </p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Lip Blush</h2>
            <div id="img2">
                <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/lip-blushing-tattoo-1600715171.gif?crop=0.5023255813953489xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:*"
                    alt="Error Loading Image" width="100%">
            </div>
            <p>Lip tattoos may bring to mind the image of a fancy grande dame with permanent lip liner who never seems
                to
                actually fill in her lips, but, according to Bray, the technique has been refined to its current form.
                Also
                known as lip blushing or lip tinting, a lip tattoo is a simple wash of sheer color across the entire
                lip.
            </p>
            <p>For example, Anusha works with her clients' natural lip shade to add a slightly deeper layer of pigment.
                The
                finished result should look like a just-bitten, blurred lip — the type of subtle lip color that looks
                like
                you've just enjoyed a make out session.</p>
            <p>One thing Anusha notes is that lip blushing is a "more intense" process compared to other permanent
                makeup
                tattoos. "Since the skin on the lips doesn't retain pigment as well as the rest of the skin, some
                clients
                require two or three touch-ups."</p>

            <h3><strong>Who should get lip blushing?</strong></h3>
            <p>If you're looking for a blurred-lip look with a slight boost in color every day, lip blushing could be a
                great option for you. However, you also have to have a pretty high pain tolerance. "Lips are a lot more
                sensitive than the other parts of the face, so people do experience pain and swelling," says Bray.

                Expect to leave your appointment a little puffy and to spend a week looking like you just got fresh lip
                injections.</p>

            <h3><Strong>How long does lip blushing last?</Strong></h3>
            <p>Once you've been through the multiple touch-up appointments needed to first achieve your desired look,
                the
                color will last about a year. "This treatment always includes two sessions spaced six weeks apart," says
                Pruett. "Results typically last three to five years, so we recommend coming back whenever the color
                needs a
                boost."</p>
            <!-- <img src="" alt=""> -->
            <h3><strong>How much does lip blushing cost?</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Lip blushng will cost you from a amount starting from <span>&#8377;</span>8000 upto
                <span>&#8377;</span>15000 depending upon the style and the type of pigment which is much lower than any
                other studio.

            <h3><strong>Permanent Eyelashes Extensions</strong></h3>
            <p>“Lash extensions are semi-permanent synthetic, faux mink or silk fibers which are applied strand by
                strand to
                your natural lashes,” explains Richardson. As you might expect, the application is fairly tedious. “The
                extensions are carefully applied one at a time using a specially-formulated, semi-permanent glue that
                will
                not irritate or damage the natural lash,” she adds.<br>

                Unlike false eyelashes, where the strip or individual lashes are applied to the skin, lash extensions
                are
                attached directly to the lash itself. The results are more lush, dense lashes that may even let you skip
                mascara (gasp).</p>

            <h3><strong>How Long Does the Process Take?</strong></h3>
            <p>The bad news? Expect the treatment to take one to two hours, depending on your desired look. The good
                news?
                You can use it as an excuse to lie down, relax, and take a forced break from your phone.<br>

                A good lash technician will take their time, reminds Richardson. “Safety should be your number-one
                concern.
                Finding someone who is certified to apply the lashes is a must. Depending on the state, the stylist also
                needs to be licensed,” she advises.</p>

            <h3><strong>How Much Do Eyelash Extensions Cost?</strong></h3>
            <p>Cost varies depending on the location, technician, and the final look. But when it comes to freelancer,
                they
                are experienced and still took very less amount as compared to others giving the comfort to do it at
                your
                own place. Anusha has a very premium client base in Delhi-NCR. You will also see the results after the
                process which will last a very long time. Coming to the price range which starts for the basic lash is
                <span>&#8377;</span>1500 which goes upto <span>&#8377;</span>4000 for the volume natural lash.
